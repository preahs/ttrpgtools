        <h1>Session Four</h1>

        <p>
            As promised, Peadraic agrees to help the party locate the old elven shrine. This is near the area
            where Deckard Maymus mentioned the next tome could be found. Peadraic warns that tensions are
            high in this region, which is home to elves, dwarves, and humans.
        </p>

        <p>
            The party spends the night at Aiden's Pub and awakens the next morning to explore the markets in
            preparation for the journey ahead. Tsemin enters a tent filled with an assortment of gems and an
            acrid, burning incense plant that gives the place an unsettling atmosphere. Inside, a psychic wearing
            a turban hands Tsemin a strange object shaped like two pyramids stacked base-to-base. Tsemin rolls
            it, and the psychic leads him through a door—only for him to find himself somewhere completely
            different. He feels detached not just from his body, but from his very identity, as though he has
            become someone else. Emotions flood in—perhaps those of Joee, or of the mystic before him.
            Suddenly, Tsemin blinks—and he's back in the tent, still holding the same gems as before.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, Othokent browses the marketplace and notices some nearby dwarves watching him
            with narrowed eyes—clearly annoyed that he's been undercutting them in both price and quality.
            One of them pulls out a notebook and writes something down. Joee searches for a poisoner's kit and
            spots one at a stall run by orcs. They're charging 11 GP, claiming it's the standard market price.
            Joee and Shushuh haggle it down to 3 GP. In a small act of revenge, Joee has Othokent enchant the
            gold to scream at 15-minute intervals, just to annoy the vendor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shushuh and Tsemin then head to the blacksmithing tent, where Tsemin quietly casts Detect
            Thoughts. He asks the smith for help repairing an unusual item. Upon seeing them, the smith
            initially assumes they're working with a bearded elder smith nearby. Tsemin insists it's a private
            matter and asks to speak alone. After some persuasion—and a surcharge for a “no questions asked”
            policy—the smith agrees to help Shushuh reattach her head. He notes, however, that his assistant
            will have to be informed, given the nature of the work. The procedure is completed successfully,
            and Shushuh is once again whole.
        </p>

        <p>
            The party returns to Aiden's Pub for the night. In the morning, they set off, but are soon pursued by
            another goblin raiding party riding hogs. One goblin, beating a drum, is humorously and notably...
            well-endowed. The party engages the mounted foes, relying primarily on ranged attacks. Mid-battle,
            a dwarf with a long white beard arrives and angrily tells Peadraic that he is not to interfere with
            affairs beyond the Irdune Wall.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moving on, the party descends into a long-sealed tunnel, walking for what feels like hours until they
            reach a moss-covered door. A carving on it depicts a fish reaching up toward a lure, surrounded by
            unfamiliar symbols. The inscription, written in Primordial, is unreadable to the party. On a pedestal
            nearby is a rune, which Othokent recognizes as representing water. Cleverly, he conjures 12 gallons
            of salt water and pours it over the rune, which triggers the door to open.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond, they find a large cavern with three doors: left, right, and center, and a pool of water. Murals
            depict an ancient underwater empire. In the next room, large bones lie scattered near a pumpkin.
            When Othokent picks up the bones and touches the pumpkin, intending to carve it, the bones rip
            from his pack and fly toward it, assembling into a skeletal construct. A fight ensues, and the rest of
            the party rushes in upon hearing Othokent's cries. After defeating the animated skeleton, they move
            on to a room with a pedestal holding an apple and a mirror reflecting nothing. On the opposite wall
            hangs a painting of an old man holding an apple. Suspecting an illusion, Tsemin reaches into the
            painting and successfully retrieves the apple.
        </p>

        <p>
            Climbing upstairs, they enter a room lined with glass tubes containing electric eels. Inside, they
            encounter fish-like humanoids and engage in combat before making a quick escape. They find two
            doors, one locked, one open. Peering into the open room, they see a rectangular space with
            columns, and a woman with snakes for hair. Realizing she is a Medusa, the party prepares carefully
            to avoid her gaze. After a tense battle, they manage to decapitate her and bag the head. Returning to
            the central chamber, Othokent uses a key found in the Medusa's room to unlock the remaining door.
            Inside, glowing gem-light reveals an inscription on the wall: “Blood is thicker than water.” Spilling
            blood allows them to proceed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Following the water pool, Othokent discovers a door leading to a drained hallway illuminated by
            gems. Ahead lies a vast and mysterious chamber, awaiting the party's next steps.
