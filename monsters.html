            <p>"Hags were universally hideous beings, but even by the unbelievably low standards applied to their race, sea hags were abysmally grotesque. Despite their penchant for devouring their victims they had an emaciated appearance, although they could be of varying height and big-boned as opposed to scraggly. Befitting their haggard nature, their flesh was also rife with warts and oozing cankers.</p>
            <p>Their complexion was like that of a rotting fish: pallid yellow skin with patches of green, slimy scales and bony protrusions. Their piscine eyes were similarly devoid of life with deep, black pupils surrounded by red.</p>
            <p>The weak-hearted were known to die upon gazing at sea hags, but fortunately they had long, limp, hair that resembled rancid seaweed, which often concealed their true forms. Even without their squalid manes, sea hags could use illusory magic to disguise their appearance, although whatever form they took, they were cursed (or perhaps in their opinion, blessed) to appear ugly."</p>

            <p>"Werewolves are a type of lycanthrope who take the form of wolves at the full moon. Werewolves are the most common type of lycanthropes on Braelendr. They are found in all climates, both in the wild and hidden in civilization. Werewolf packs are organized similar to wolf packs, with a powerful alpha in command of the entire group. The moral and ethical outlook of the pack tends to follow that of the alpha."</p>
