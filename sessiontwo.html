        <h1>Session Two</h1>

        <p>
            The party leaves the bar as screams fill the air. Beneath their feet, grass and clovers begin to sprout
            from the once-scorched earth. Orla speaks, knowing the party is listening, and explains that what
            she is doing is necessary to cleanse the land of its scourge and restore it to its former state before the
            New Gods. Through her actions, she claims, her gods will return. Meanwhile, the villagers inside
            the wickerman are either already dead or so irreparably burned that saving them might be crueler
            than letting them perish.
        </p>

        <p>
            Orla bids the party farewell, promising they will meet again, before leaping into the wickerman's
            flames and vanishing. For a brief moment, Cathbad's form appears in the rising smoke before
            fading away. Tsemin attempts to mitigate the damage by casting frost where people touch the
            flames, while Joee and Shushuh scan the surrounding buildings for villagers in distress. However,
            the townspeople, enraged, begin throwing rocks at the party, blaming them for the tragedy and
            demanding they leave. With no other choice, the group departs toward Stogelheim.
        </p>

        <p>
            As they travel, the dead trees of Branfor transform into lush, moss-covered groves, their branches
            full of leaves. The croaking of frogs begins to fill the night air—the land is coming back to life.
            Suddenly, the rhythmic drumbeats of the goblin band echo through the darkness. They approach,
            asking for more gifts from Othokent, but the party has nothing to offer. The goblins grumble,
            explaining that they cannot pass through the peat swamp due to a fae enemy residing within. It
            seems the fae in this region have little tolerance for those who go barefoot. The goblin leader also
            mentions that many soldiers have been stationed throughout Donegalion, fearing the return of
            something ominous. Before departing, he gives the party a cryptic warning: “The Dark One still
            follows.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The group reaches the wetlands and spots a sign reminding travelers to keep their shoes clean in the
            bog. They make camp for the night before pressing onward. Othokent crafts a pair of shoes tailored
            to his lizardfolk feet, while the others wrap their footwear in moss to comply with the sign's
            warning.
        </p>

        <p>
            As they proceed, they find the path flooded with waist-deep water. Shushuh lifts Tsemin, while the
            group debates the best way to keep their shoes clean. Joee opts to travel through the trees to avoid
            leeches, while the others wade through cautiously. They move from pond to pond without incident,
            but the moss wrappings around their shoes quickly become soaked and require frequent
            replacement.
        </p>

        <p>
            After some time, a distant cry for help catches their attention. Tsemin sends his owl to investigate
            and discovers Shaymus, the bug salesman, trapped shoulder-deep in the bog. Othokent deftly tosses
            a grappling hook and uses Mage Hand to secure it around Shaymus, allowing Shushuh and Joee to
            haul him to safety. The party informs Shaymus of Winenut's demise, directing him to where his
            family resides. In gratitude, he gifts them a psychoactive frog.
        </p>

        <p>
            Noticing Shaymus's dirty shoes, the party warns him to clean them. He curses the “demon
            cobblers,” explaining that if these entities see unclean footwear, they will either kill or deceive the
            offender. Othokent purchases three mason jars from Shaymus and cleans his shoes before he
            departs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shortly after, Othokent detects a nearby fae presence—a leprechaun. The small creature offers a
            deal: if they retrieve his missing, shiny buckled shoe, he will lift the bog's fog and spare them.
            However, Othokent and Joee become distracted by the leprechaun's map, more interested in stealing
            it than fulfilling his request. Meanwhile, Tsemin and Shushuh investigate the murky waters and spot
            what appears to be a body at the bottom. When Tsemin retrieves it, he realizes it is only half a
            person. Suddenly, shadowy figures emerge from the bog—undead corpses, perfectly preserved yet
            animated by unnatural forces.
        </p>

        <p>
            A battle ensues. The party fights valiantly, slaying the swamp creatures. Among the remains, they
            find the leprechaun's lost shoe and promptly return it. True to his word, the fae lifts the fog and
            returns their shoes, now impeccably cleaned. As an additional reward, he gifts them one of his gold
            coins before disappearing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Continuing their journey, the group hunts an elk, securing antlers and rations before camping for the
            night. As they leave the bog, the landscape shifts—the scent of wheat fills the air, and fine grass
            carpets the ground. In the distance, massive stone walls rise, with travelers in horse-drawn carts
            heading south toward Donegalion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Approaching a stone tower, they spot soldiers wearing breastplates emblazoned with a lion and
            carrying a red-and-yellow banner—Donegalion's colors, distinct from Stogelheim's. These troops
            have been stationed to address potential disturbances. Near a farmer's home, the party knocks on
            the door, asking where they might clean the filth from the bog off their clothes. The farmer directs
            them to a stream two kilometers east.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon arrival, the farmer offers to wash their garments in exchange for help with farm work. The
            party agrees. As they finish, a squad of Donegalion soldiers approaches, questioning the farmer
            about rumored foreigners in the area. Othokent, quick-witted, convinces them that the group is
            merely a band of traveling merchants lacking proper immigration papers. Satisfied, the soldiers
            depart, and shortly after, so does the party.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the city's main gate, guards carefully inspect passports and identification. Tsemin and Shushuh
            receive a standard black stamp, allowing them entry. However, Othokent is given a red stamp,
            requiring additional customs inspection, while Joee receives a green stamp, sending him to
            immigration. To prevent a party split, Joee cleverly uses magic to alter his stamp to red, joining the
            others as they enter the city.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inside the courtyard, a massive statue stands at its center—a dwarf and a human holding hands as
            they strike down an elf foe, a clear testament to the region's disdain for elves. Nearby, Othokent
            notices a group of prostitutes and, with mischief in mind, pays one two silver to lick one of his
            magical toads. She becomes delirious and slumps to the ground, drawing the ire of her pimp.
            Approaching Othokent, the man demands compensation but ultimately decides to let it slide unless
            it becomes a recurring issue.
        </p>

        <p>
            The day concludes with the party stepping into Aiden's Pub, assessing the beer prices and preparing
            to sell their own wares in hopes of establishing a financial foothold in the city.
