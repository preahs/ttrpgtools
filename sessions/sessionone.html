    <h1>Session One</h1>
    <p>The party stops for the night at Agis Bar in Winenut, taking the opportunity to gather information
about nearby ruins. Othokent strikes up a conversation with a goblin slave, Cornelius—derisively
nicknamed "Gwimbley." The goblin reveals that the ruins were once dedicated to the old gods.
Later, the party turns to gambling to pass the evening.</p>
    <p>Joee joins a game of blackjack, seated opposite an orc named Gög. Scheming with Othokent and
    Tsemin, Joee cheats by switching cards while Gög is distracted. Furious upon discovering the trick,
    Gög challenges Joee to a fight. However, Tsemin subtly shrinks the orc's club using magic, further
    enraging him. Eventually, Gög backs down, paying Joee his winnings.</p>
    <p>That night, the group squeezes into a single room to rest. Over breakfast the next morning, they
inquire about a mysterious, black-hooded figure they noticed at the inn. This figure, a High
Priestess of the Church of Olster named Orla, agrees to meet them at her chapel in an hour to
exchange information.</p>
    <p>Before heading to the chapel, Othokent befriends Gög by generously sharing endless beer. As the
party crosses a field en route to the chapel, they pass a stone circle with a patch of ash—likely used
for town bonfires. A few party members sense an ominous aura of dark magic emanating from the
area.</p>
    <p>Inside the chapel, the group finds statues of gods and mysterious runes adorning the walls. Othokent
casts a fireball at an effigy, claiming he saw a burning wickerman in a vision, setting it ablaze. Orla
emerges and, rather than being alarmed, calmly explains that the effigy was meant to be burned that
evening as part of a ritual to honor departed spirits. Orla confides in the party about her efforts to
preserve the worship of the old gods and shares crucial information: she possesses a tome that holds
the key to unlocking the shrine of Amleth Boru, where the fabled harp lies hidden. However, she
will only part with the tome if the party retrieves a magical orb, the palantír, from the perilous ruins
of Cathbad—haunted by the twisted remnants of the black magic he once wielded. The party agrees
to assist in this endeavor in order to obtain the tome from the high priestess.</p>
    <p>The party ventures to the ruins, placing a stone Orla provided into a circle of stones to open the
crypt. As the ground rumbles, a band of goblins appears, chanting cryptically. They warn the party
that a hooded man is searching for them before vanishing into the shadows. Undeterred, the group
descends into the crypt.</p>
    <p>Shushuh discovers a locked series of doors, most of which resist attempts to pick or damage them,
as though the crypt itself is alive. Eventually, they find an unlocked door leading into a tight, dark
room where they encounter four rotting, animated corpses. After a tense battle, the party triumphs,
though Shushuh suffers a grievous wound oozing a strange black fluid. In the aftermath, they
discover a chest containing a key.</p>
    <p>Using the key, they progress to another room housing a magical stone on an altar. The stone carries
a cryptic warning about rest, and experimentation reveals its ability to make objects disappear. The
party uses the stone to dissolve a door, gaining access to the main hallway and a previously locked
door.</p>
    <p>Beyond this door lies a puzzling chamber with a small stone gnome, a glass pane, and a button on
the floor. Othokent cleverly stores the gnome in the magical stone, tosses it through a hole in the
pane, and retrieves it on the other side. The gnome animates, steps on the button to unlock the door,
and then returns to the magical stone for safekeeping.</p>
    <p>The room is pitch black when they enter, but there is a clacking reverberating throughout the room.
Joee throws a light to the other side of the room, revealing a sole skeleton. A drop of water drops on
Shushuh's shoulders, and she looks up to see a grated platform supported by chains. Joee uses his
grappling hook to get on top of the platform and sees two switches. Othokent's summoned servants
go atop the platform and pull both of the switches down at once. The group notices that half of the
room is lit up suddenly, but the lights they brought are now useless. The skeleton animates and the
room rotates into the opposite orientation.</p>
    <p>With more experimentation, another switch is toggled and the light switches directions again. The
skeleton is still animated but grabs its bow, unseen. One switch controls which side the light is on,
and the other controls the physical orientation of the room. Shushuh slays the skeleton by swinging
her weapon as Othokent toggles the switch, and they successfully get the last key and enter into a
much larger chamber.</p>
    <p>There are five glowing buttons, a trap door in the center, and a horde of zombies in the room.
Othokent pours oil along the horde and lights it with a fireball, making the creatures in the way
recoil in pain and retreat to reveal a clear path to one of the buttons. Othokent places his backpack
on the button to hold it down while the rest of the party throws various objects at the rest of the
buttons and unlock the trap door, revealing a staircase going down.</p>
    <p>The palantír sits at the end of the room. As Othokent picks up the orb, all light in the room is sucked
into the orb and the party is surrounded by pitch black. A spirit forms out of the walls, and a large
ethereal green satyr with no eyes appears: Cathbad's hostile ghost haunting these ruins.</p>
    <p>After an intense battle, Cathbad is finally decapitated and all of the darkness in the surrounding area
absorbs back into his eyes and his body fades away. The evil foe is defeated, and the crypt is
successfully purified, the palantír claimed by the group.</p>
    <p>Returning to the chapel, the group finds Orla in prayer. She examines Shushuh's wound, noting its
unnatural qualities but offering no immediate remedy. True to her word, Orla exchanges the tome
for the palantír.</p>
    <p>However, after the group goes to sleep, they awaken late into the night to bloodcurling screams.
Looking out the window, a giant wickerman, much like Orla makes, is burning with innocent
villagers inside.</p>
