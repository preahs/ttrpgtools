        <p>
            Abhartach rises from his throne and outstretches his finger. The stones spiraling around the party begin to shift, and the army of Abhartach rises, skin pale and eyes red. “You fools… you have failed me. The council should not know of this. I will give you the tome, if you should survive long enough to get it. Kill them,” the ancient elf commands, his thralls responding by slinking toward the group.
        </p>

        <p>
            A vampire grabs Shushuh and slashes her deeply with its claws, earning a scream of pain from the warforged. Shushuh throws off the clothes covering her, making her transform into a werewolf. She attacks the vampire with the same violent vigor. As Joee is fighting off another one, he vaguely recalls that there is a specific action one must do to end these vile creatures' lives. Well into the battle, Joee finally remembers that in order to kill them, you need to pierce their heart with a wooden stake.
        </p>

        <p>
            Joee breaks a torch in half, creating a makeshift stake. In the meantime, Abhartach disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving the party alone without the tome. By this point, all of the thralls are incapacitated and writhing on the ground, and the party finished them off using broken torches. While they have won against their temporary enemies, their true enemy and prize have left.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shushuh notices that on the ground where Abhartach originally was, there is a signet ring lying on the ground. She picks it up and studies it, noting it has a gold band with a maple leaf crest on it, and then gives it to Othokent. He determines there may have been some alchemical skill applied in creating it. The group decides to head back to town, carrying evidence of the vampire thralls.
        </p>

        <p>
            The council members are waiting for them, beckoning them inside the hall, signaling that they were awaiting their arrival. An air of general anxiety and uncertainty permeates the room. One of the elves, Yurael, introduces himself as the leader of the council of Everfall. He asks the group how all of the recent events could have happened, referring to the werewolf transformation and working with Abhartach in general. The group explains that they only wanted to help, and were tricked by Abhartach to do his bidding. Yurael summons the local truth-seer, Lundruil, to determine everyone's intentions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Othokent explains how they are looking for tomes, and pulls out the ring found earlier, explaining his theory on alchemical use. The council inspects it, the court alchemist saying that he recognizes the power of the item. He says it is the old signet ring of the King of Everfall, leaving a warning that he is the true ruler and has the authority to dictate this land. The alchemist, naming himself Cedraig, continues that he knows the ring was turned from silver to gold, leading them to the knowledge that he did so because he cannot wear silver. This is his ultimate weakness, as a vampire. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The council agrees to let them proceed in their quest for the tomb. Cedraig explains that he expects Abhartach to be retreating to the Umber Keep, a large, ancient, and impregnable castle. He says that there is a cave near the town with mineshafts used long ago that the party can use to make their way to the Umber Keep somewhat safely.
        </p>

        <p>
            After gathering their thoughts and plans about moving forward to the mines, the party takes a break at the nearby inn to gather rations and rest. Othokent and Shushuh are debating over the word “underling” and why it may not be the best word to describe allies when Gört approaches, giving a suggestion that the word pal may be most appropriate, although he is not sure how to spell it. After a light-hearted debate, everyone heads to bed to prepare for a long journey. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In the morning, the party heads out to the mouth of the cave. Deep down, the path is paved not with stone but with minecart tracks. The shaft is short, but thin, and it seems to have been used historically to cart materials rather than people. There are small tracks and muddy clay around, the rats quite large, and most notably some creature's tracks seem to be goblin tracks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rounding a corner, the group hears cackling and knocks on stone. It is dank and dark, humid and uncomfortable, and eventually they see a band of goblins ahead. Their skin is remarkably pale green, and their ears seem larger than most goblins, their clothes sewn from rodents. There are six in front of them, subsisting off of a rat feast. Othokent calls out to them, and they respond slowly with crackling voices in disjointed Goblin, expressing that they are locked in this place, offering to show them “big man.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The goblins run off into the darkness on all fours, like a lesser animal would, the group following them. They hear screaming, and rounding a corner, they see a dwarf gripping a goblin by the neck, strangling him. Interestingly, the dwarf is half-covered in stone and stuck in place. Othokent shoots a fiery bullet at the dwarf, and the dwarf screams in pain and frustration, explaining that the goblins refuse to bring him wine and only bring water, which was why he was torturing the one goblin. He says his name is Galar, and Othokent creates wine and gives it to him, causing him much joy. He has a very long and grey beard, quite unkempt, so seemingly he is stuck under the stone rubble and has been unable to take care of himself or acquire wine of his own for some time. He says it may have been about one hundred years since he was trapped.
        </p>

        <p>
            Galar expresses his desire to forge one last item before expiring. Joee cautiously asks whether his one last item could be made of silver to assist them in their quest to fight Abhartach, and the dwarf agrees, if they are able to free him. Shushuh puts in the work to remove the rubble, freeing the dwarf, although he is crippled at this point. He warns the party that they will need a mold to design the silver sword they desire, as well as coal and silver. Galar points out each respective tunnel for what is needed.
        </p>

        <p>
            After some deliberating, the group decides on a silver pike and dagger as their weapons of choice to aim for. They split up, Othokent and Joee going for the silver and Shushuh and Tsemin going for the coal. Othokent and Joee approach the goblins guarding the silver, noticing how they value its sheen. Othokent attempts to strike a trade, the golden signet ring for just enough silver. He wants more silver, however, and offers alchemical wine as well, for a total of three large chunks of the precious metal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, Shushuh and Tsemin sneak their way down a tunnel, and eventually find a cart full of coal, although they feel something foul surrounding it. There is a small pool of lava next to it, and Tsemin feels as if there is some sort of living essence to the coal and the surrounding fire. Shushuh picks up a piece of coal, and it jumps out of her hand and form into a body, screaming in an unfamiliar language. Then, the rest of the coal forms into a full body along with the lava, also screaming, warning them to not disturb it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shushuh attempts to search for other coal, but only finds some embedded in stone, requiring a pickaxe to mine. She relents that they should try to fight the living coal, so they approach it and start attacking. Tsemin casts Shape Water to cause the water to flow at the fire creature, attempting to envelope it. It evidently damages it greatly, and meanwhile, Shushuh focuses on using her flail to attack the coal creature. Soon, the coal and fire combine into one entity, a flaming pile of coal, much more intimidating than before.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a hearty battle, the duo has a pile of coal. They push the cart, Tsemin creating smoke to cover their tracks from any surrounding enemies. Othokent and Joee return to the rendezvous with the silver and deliver all the materials to the dwarf for forging. Eventually, the weapons are complete, the dwarf assisting the party to help pour, smelt, and hammer. The group decides to name the resulting pike Buffae and the dagger Hell Sing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The party continues traveling, seeing many metals and gems around them in the central shaft. Shushuh spots a nugget of gold stuck in the wall, and the party decides to split the earnings amongst themselves. Continuing down, at the end, and crouched down, they find another opening. The floors are covered in soft, dry, cave vines, seemingly separate from the rest of the mineshaft. The group takes a short rest before continuing.
        </p>

        <p>
            A cave troll emerges out of the cave system, brandishing his large club, embedded with gems. Othokent attempts to move past him, holding a torch to distract him, but everyone else decides to start a fight instead to get him out of the way. In the end, Shushuh decapitates the troll and Othokent relents enough to harvest its bones. Soon after, they exit the tunnels, and behold the great Umber Keep, where Abhartach resides and awaits them. The castle is of black stone and cobble, with strange geometry, at least 10,000 years old. A great piece of architecture, awaiting the party for pillaging.

        <p>
            Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.
