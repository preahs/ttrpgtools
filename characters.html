        <h2>Tsemin</h2>
        <h3 class="char-info">Race: Yako Kitsune | Class: Moon Druid | Background: Bandit Defector</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="/assets/img/tsemin_by_fawks_on_tumblr.png" alt="Tsemin">

        </figure>

            <p class="description">
                As a defector from far east, Tsemin naturally drifts out of line, whether it be in his urbane appearance, his selfish lifestyle, or in taking up a strange quest in this foreign land. With rusty hair obscuring a bold, black eye patch and a belt stuffed with an inexplicable number and variety of fabrics like a skirt, it's hard enough to tell what he's got on him... and yet more than just hiding the armory of an adventurer, he secretly embodies the wild witchcraft of cultists, druids, and kitsune alike.
                But when you really get to know him, Tsemin is like a sack of potatoes. Alone, his sly words and halfwit schemes miss the mark. If you sling him around, he's clumsy and prone to collateral damage. His personal baggage, anything but unique, drags along too. But given the right plan, the right partners in crime, and some luck, his potential is limitless.

        <h2>Shushuh</h2>
        <h3 class="char-info">Race: Warforged | Class: Fighter | Background: Soldier</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/shushuh.jpg" alt="Shushuh">

        <p class="description">
            Shushuh was born into a time of turmoil and conflict, and her early years were shaped by the echoes of war as a warforged created by a compassionate wizard. The next 12 years of her life were dedicated to the battlefield. She believes war is a crucible; it shapes you, hardens you, but also reveals who you truly are. Shushuh learned discipline and strategy, but Shushuh also learned compassion—the value of life, the importance of camaraderie, and the price of sacrifice. Shushuh returned to a world that had moved on without her, and for a time, Shushuh felt adrift. Yet, she also saw this as an opportunity to grow beyond the soldier she had been. With time, she rebuilt herself. Shushuh pursued lawful bounty hunting and mercenary work for money, went on many meditative pilgrimages, and yet struggled to make deep friendships. After 6 years of wandering from city to forest, restless and unable to settle anywhere, she is now pursue meaning and a set passion for something real.

    <div class="character-card" id="othokent">
        <h2>Othokent</h2>
        <h3 class="char-info">Race: Lizardfolk | Class: Artificer | Background: Outlander</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="/assets/img/othokent.png" alt="Othokent">
            <figcaption>Art by @oatdate</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="description">
            A socially unadept and limitlessly curious lizardfolk, Othokent stepped down as the former shaman of his tribe many years ago. A sense of curiosity and discovery are his fuel, engine, and wheels for the life he lives. Othokent always finds a way to stand out: whether it be through his shorter statute, vibrant blue-and-green color scheme, and iconic smith's goggles; or his inability to conform to societal norms, such as talking in the third-person, interacting with anyone and anything, and not knowing the art of minding one's own business, Othokent draws in glances wherever Othokent goes.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
            Othokent's prowess includes harnessing organic material as conduits of arcane energy, being well-adept for life outside of civilization, and knowing how to creatively work in a variety of mediums. His shield, blunderbuss, and alchemy jug are all handmade and engineered from bones of fallen prey or foes. He's quite the cunning artisan, and is proud to function as the swiss-army knife of this band of misfits.

    <div class="character-card" id="joee">
        <h2>Joee</h2>
        <h3 class="char-info">Race: Tabaxi | Class: Rogue Scout | Background: Veteran</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/joee.jpg" alt="Joee">

        <p class="description">
            Joee was a former scout for his rogue guild located in a land similar to Norway. Operating alone mostly, he would eliminate his targets from long distances leaving little trace, and often was gone for weeks at a time. Despite his overall lack of availability and outward gruffiness, he was generally well liked among his guild and even fell in love with a fellow tabaxi in his guild, Tarwea. However, partially due to the semi-sexist expectations of the guild towards women, the fact that Joee would be gone for unreasonable amounts of time and the outward emotional disconnection brought home from that distance, Tarwea left the guild while Joee was on an assignment, leaving him in shambles on his return. Unable to live with the structure of the guild anymore, Joee left in hopes of finding Tarwea and proving himself to be a better husband and better man.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
            However, being a better husband definitely requires some form of capital, so Joee takes up pretty much any job he can find. Often alone, or with previously formed groups, Joee became content with being outcasted and purely job focused. However, a ragtag group of unique jobmates all aimed towards the same goal might help him to open up again and improve on the emotional aspect of being a better man/husband. He tends to take a back burner roll of the group, doesn't really lead conversations, but does provide input and carries his own weight.

        <p class="description">
            Once a farmhand, he was kidnapped by pirates and enslaved in a distant land. Over time, he learned their language and eventually escaped, guided by divine voices to the coast. After returning home, he devoted himself to the new gods and sought to spread their message in Braelendr, comparing their trinitarian nature to the three leaves of a clover.
