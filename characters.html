            <p class="description">
                As a defector from far east, Tsemin naturally drifts out of line, whether it be in his urbane appearance, his selfish lifestyle, or in taking up a strange quest in this foreign land. With rusty hair obscuring a bold, black eye patch and a belt stuffed with an inexplicable number and variety of fabrics like a skirt, it's hard enough to tell what he's got on him... and yet more than just hiding the armory of an adventurer, he secretly embodies the wild witchcraft of cultists, druids, and kitsune alike.
                But when you really get to know him, Tsemin is like a sack of potatoes. Alone, his sly words and halfwit schemes miss the mark. If you sling him around, he's clumsy and prone to collateral damage. His personal baggage, anything but unique, drags along too. But given the right plan, the right partners in crime, and some luck, his potential is limitless.

        <h2>Shushuh</h2>

        <p class="description">
            Shushuh was born into a time of turmoil and conflict, and her early years were shaped by the echoes of war as a warforged created by a compassionate wizard. The next 12 years of her life were dedicated to the battlefield. She believes war is a crucible; it shapes you, hardens you, but also reveals who you truly are. Shushuh learned discipline and strategy, but Shushuh also learned compassionâ€”the value of life, the importance of camaraderie, and the price of sacrifice. Shushuh returned to a world that had moved on without her, and for a time, Shushuh felt adrift. Yet, she also saw this as an opportunity to grow beyond the soldier she had been. With time, she rebuilt herself. Shushuh pursued lawful bounty hunting and mercenary work for money, went on many meditative pilgrimages, and yet struggled to make deep friendships. After 6 years of wandering from city to forest, restless and unable to settle anywhere, she is now pursue meaning and a set passion for something real.
