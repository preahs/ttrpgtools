        <h1>Session Six</h1>
        
        <p>
            After a night at the tavern, the party observes wild animals living among the townsfolk. Tsemin and Shushuh are outside, with Tsemin feeling the beauty of the morning and obtaining a Name's Day Wish, when suddenly a hooded figure captures Shushuh.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tsemin pursues in direwolf form through the forest, catching up with the assailant as he moves quickly through the underbrush. When Tsemin asks where he is going, the figure replies that his "master needs this one." Shushuh struggles free and escapes, knocking the figure down. The stranger still insists he requires Shushuh, warning Tsemin to stay away, worry evident on his face.
        </p>

        <p>
            "There is a large conspiracy in this land. Know this—I need you to save the people of Everfall and the destiny of the elves," he says, claiming he was also sent by the king of Everfall. Shushuh refuses to go with him without her companions, and the stranger reluctantly agrees to these terms. Shushuh reunites with the rest of the party and discusses the situation with them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everyone is generally skeptical, but they agree to accompany Shushuh to investigate. They meet the stranger at the fork in the road as discussed and travel down the path. They discover an extremely large, dead, hollowed-out tree with several cages made of the same wood hanging nearby. In the center of the hollowed tree, a female elf named Arael sits meditating. Othokent speaks with the elf, noticing that the energy surrounding the cages in the trees flickers occasionally.
        </p>

        <p>
            She explains her distaste for the race of man, asking Shushuh what the hooded figure wanted with her. Shushuh initially lies, but the elf sees through it and explains that he is part of the Dark Ones and that there is no king of Everfall. She reveals that they serve King Abhartach, or someone who once was a king, and that they have separated themselves from the rest of society. He is the oldest living elf, but his respect for the kingdom was waning, so he erected the wall separating the elves from the rest of society.
        </p>

        <p>
            She suggests going after Abhartach to find out what he is doing and why he is taking animals and disrupting the land. In exchange, she offers to try swaying the council to allow the goblins to become their own kingdom, as well as providing the party with Everfall's hospitality.
        </p>

        <p>
            They meet the hooded figure, whom the party names Herbert, much to his dismay. Herbert leads them down the path, and the party notices many corvids among the dead woods. A mist begins to form the deeper they venture into the wood, eventually completely covering Herbert and causing the group to lose sight of him. As they continue further, they realize they are going off the path in their attempt to pursue him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wandering through the mist, Joee runs into their guide, knocking him over, before noticing that everyone is now in a clearing. There is a stone in the middle with runes carved in Elvish that read:
        </p>

        <p>
            “The elves of blood,
            the elves of night,
            the elves of Abhartach”
        </p>

        <p>
            Herbert tells Shushuh to touch the stone with increasing desperation, insisting that she will save them. Shushuh declines and demands to know why and what she is getting into. Tsemin detects his thoughts and determines that Shushuh will be mostly okay.
        </p>

        <p>
            After much debate—with Herbert providing little helpful information—Shushuh decides to touch the stone. She definitely feels something strange within her, though she is uncertain what the feeling is. It seems to be a dark presence, bound with her blood. Herbert declares his purpose complete, slitting his own throat and killing himself.
        </p>

        <p>
            The party travels east, and after a short time they find the clearing that Tsemin's bat scout had sensed before. There is a very large circle in this clearing, perhaps containing graves. In the clearing sits a large, broad elf in a stone chair. The person he is speaking with seems familiar, but they can only see them from behind. The man turns around, revealing dark purple skin and a mustache, and they realize he is the fae they initially met in the tower, the one who knocked them out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Carcasses of deer lie all around the elf standing before the party. His eyes seem unnaturally tired. Upon his head rests an archaic golden crown with many gems. His numerous rings give off a magical aura. He says he is King Abhartach. Shushuh and Joee notice that hanging from his belt is a tome that resembles the other tomes they have been attempting to collect. He sees them staring and says he is the original author of the tome.
        </p>

        <p>
            He knows they already possess a few tomes, and he claims not to know what the stone Shushuh touched does or why Herbert wanted her to touch it. He asks for a favor from the party, saying he knows that many men are trapped in the elven prison. He believes the entrapment of these humans leads to unnecessary tension and desires them to be freed. He asks them to free the men from the hollowed tree prison to remedy the divide between the races.
        </p>

        <p>
           The party agrees after listening to his historical account, and Abhartach casts a light to lead them back to the village. It is now afternoon, and the party has some time before nightfall to rest and handle other matters. 
        </p>

        <p>
            They plan the jailbreak, moving into action once well rested. Joee disguises himself as a humanoid of an unidentified race with a torch to threaten fire, while Othokent casts Shatter. Two guards emerge from the hollow tree and look around the forest, then run toward Othokent, who has cast invisibility on Joee so he can make his escape. Othokent and Shushuh testify that they encountered a loud noise and a fiery explosion. The elves scan around and see a light in the distance, exclaiming that they think that may be the assailant. Othokent and Shushuh easily convince them that it was a hostile humanoid going in that direction.
        </p>

        <p>
            The party returns to their tavern room and gets drunk to cover their tracks. At the council meeting, they learn that there have been some animal attacks at night, but regardless, the humans were freed by Tsemin. The group rests, quite tired from the long night.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next favor Abhartach requested was to light the beacon near town to signal the return of the fae. In the morning, they set out to the beacon north of the village. They light the beacon, and Abhartach tells them the final task: attend the final council meeting tonight. As they return to town, they see that many people are somewhat in a fuss as they observe smoke ascending into the sky. The party returns to the tavern and sees many elves, including one elf who appears to be a man with a mustache, interestingly. Tsemin detects his thoughts and notes he is worried about the upcoming harvest.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tsemin introduces himself and learns the elf's name is Gört. He explains that he drank heavily and his darkvision has disappeared, revealing that he is indeed an elf, despite his appearance. As night begins to fall, the party sees Arael heading toward the council meeting. Arael thanks them for helping with the attack the other night, but she fears that Abhartach is trying to interfere with what they have built and summon the fae to undermine their elven democracy.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the full moon rises over the council meeting chamber, Shushuh transforms into a terrible abomination of fur and metal… a werewolf. She attacks Othokent, but shortly after the fight begins, Tsemin climbs to the rooftop and blocks the moonlight, transforming Shushuh back to her normal self. The council members, outraged, interrogate the party and ask why this happened. Tsemin pleads with them, claiming it was a mistake, and the council says they may be able to cure Shushuh, but that they now have reason to strike against Abhartach because of the transformation. Tsemin covers Shushuh in multiple layers of clothing as they exit to prevent a second transformation, heading back to Abhartach to discuss the next step.
        </p>

        <p>
            The group sees ten of the bodies they released from prison lying around the King when they arrive. Abhartach is displeased that the council is not dead, but an agreement is an agreement. He says his soul is now dead and gone, and he feeds upon the life of other creatures. The party notices that the corpses on the ground have wounds on their necks, drained of blood. Abhartach is a beast of another kind.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary/werewolf-mm.html">Werewolf</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
            A werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tendency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far-a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.
