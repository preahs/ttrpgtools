        <h1>Session Five</h1>

        <p>
            The party approaches a slimy, fish-sigil-marked door, identical to the one seen at the dungeon's
            entrance. Inside, a mist-filled chamber is dimly lit by eerie crystals. Though their light cuts through
            the fog, faint illumination from above makes visibility difficult. In the center of the room, three
            hooded figures conduct a strange ritual within a circle filled with fish.
        </p>

        <p>
            Without hesitation, the party engages the cultists. Inscribed runes above the circle read:
            <b>“Sea Lord Dagon, Prince of Evil.”</b> Othokent opens the attack with a firebolt. When the cultists
            lower their hoods, the party sees their true forms: sea hags, hideous and capable of devastating
            group spellcasting. As the battle concludes, one hag raises her arms and communes with a faraway
            force. A sudden, overwhelming sensation grips the party, one of salt, seaweed, and the crushing
            pressure of the ocean. Then the hag falls, leaving behind one final, whispered word in their minds:
            <b>“Dagon.”</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Two doors open. One leads back to the dungeon entrance, the other to a side chamber. Shushuh
            recalls tales of Dagon from her homeland: an ancient, world-spanning god more primordial than the
            current pantheon. While looting the hags, she discovers the tome the party has long sought.
            Meanwhile, Tsemin opens a large chest to find the source of the mist, a never-ending smoke bottle,
            along with a trove of items. These include an
            <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#immovable%20rod_xdmg">Immovable Rod</a>, an
            <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#amulet%20of%20proof%20against%20detection%20and%20location_xdmg">Amulet of Proof Against Detection</a>, some fur-lined tweed and
            leather boots with an icy aura to it called
            <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#boots%20of%20the%20winterlands_xdmg">Boots of the WinterLands</a>, and some gold pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a short rest, the party exits the dungeon. Five hours of trekking later, they emerge onto a vast
            valley overlooking the sea. The entrance behind them is now gone. Shipwrecks litter the shore. To
            the right, a dense forest hugging the cliffs. To the left, a cold, jagged mountain range. They realize
            they are in the Bay of Blood.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their path forward splits: journey through Everfall, the kingdom of the elves, or brave the Black
            Mountains, domain of goblins and dwarves. Choosing Everfall, the party presses on into the cold.
            Everyone has some protection from the weather except Joee. They approach a man with a bushy
            beard and a blue tunic, a red hat, and round spectacles, smoking a pipe while whittling in the hopes
            of striking a deal for apparel fitting for the weather. Upon asking his name, he says his name is
            Berendoll Leafyboots, a <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#gnome_xphb">gnome</a>. Gnomes are not seen as much in this country,
            compared with leprechauns. They find out he is a guide for travelers such as them, whether to
            Everfall or the Black Mountains. He offers his services for 5 GP, and the group decides to accept his
            offer.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a restful night at his camp, they set off through the icy wilderness. Though a few party
            members struggle, they make progress and stop to eat. Shushuh and Joee go puffin hunting near the
            cliffs. That night, while the party sleeps in a small cave, Shushuh spots two intruders sneaking in
            with bags, trying to kidnap sleeping members. She strikes with her greatsword, waking the others,
            and chases one attempting to flip a hidden stone panel. She fails, triggering a trapdoor.
        </p>

        <p>
            The group falls into a goblin mine. Berendoll sheepishly admits the goblins believe he owes them
            indentured servants. Now deep beneath the mountains, they find themselves in the realm of the
            Mountain King. Goblins burst into song as they herd the party into minecarts. After a wild ride, they
            arrive before a grotesquely fat goblin atop a mound of bones and treasure. He introduces himself as
            King Bingus and demands to know why they've trespassed. The king expresses disgust at
            Leafyboots, and attempts to get gifts out of Othokent, since he is aware of his ability to manifest
            great gifts. Bingus accepts a gift that is able to minorly teleport items, and asks why they are in his
            lands. The party explains that they are attempting to earn their keep and are currently on a quest for
            an important individual, and Bingus says he wants as much money as he can possibly get in
            exchange for letting them go free to complete their quest.
        </p>

        <p>
            He requests for Othokent to kneel and swear his allegiance as his new knight, and Othokent obliges.
            Due to the danger of their situation, and the view of hundreds of goblins at the king's command, the
            rest of the party decides the best course of action is to also agree to his terms. Othokent is rewarded
            a tabard to display his allegiance to Bingus. However, Leafyboots is not on good terms with the
            goblins, and despite much persuading, Bingus takes Leafyboots away to do as he wishes, leaving
            the party without a guide. The group is escorted to the exit, seeing strange happenings as they are
            transported out, and funnily enough they meet Leafyboots at the top. He innocently explains that he
            used his wooden dagger to get out of his sticky situation, and through <i>Detect Magic</i>, the magic
            casters of the group determine that his dagger reeks of deep, dark magic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Leafyboots requests his gold back, and the party uncomfortably gives it to him. They continue
            resting, since their previous rest was interrupted. In the morning, Leafyboots makes them breakfast,
            his wooden dagger on his person. Joee conspires to steal this dagger in an attempt to gain an upper
            hand, but ends up only incapacitated and confused.
        </p>

        <p>
            After another day's journey, they get to the peak. Bright orange leaves are all over the ground, and
            Elvish singing focused on feasting fills the air. The trees around the party seem ancient and tall,
            blazed with the colors of fire. They approach a village after a long time of traveling, and it is filled
            with elves, and only one human who they have met before, Sean O'Mallory, the barber, who is
            giving an elf a haircut. Sean offers a haircut, and tells Joee that he has heard of a spy working for
            the dwarves in the village. Dwarves are always shooting down ships in the Bay of Blood, and the
            elves have been stuck in the valley for hundreds of years, making them fearful of outsiders. He
            recommends visiting the local tavern for their famous mead.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shushuh gets eyed at quite a bit through town, causing many whisperings. The village is very
            intricate, called Harvest Haven, and most houses are high in the treetops. It is noticeably a
            confusing layout meant for minds with sharp reflexes. Tsemin writes a message via raven to the
            leader of the elves and Peadric,
        </p>

        <p>
            “A sea hag coven for dark Dagon,<br>
            no selkies but still fish-like pagans,<br>
            we spilt blood to escape<br>
            and now on seascape<br>
            we find our way to the elf haven.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The party goes to the Maple Sap Inn for the time being, and notices that the only food items are
            either hunted or gathered, such an an assortment of berries or wild game. Joee begins a game called
            “Three Men's Morris”, which is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, winning his first game and earning two
            silver. He asks the elf he is playing with about rumors, and the elf informs him about the prison
            nearby, which is in a very large dead stump. The group stays at the inn for the night, but the
            innkeeper does not appreciate Shushuh's presence, since she looks like a human, so Tsemin decides
            to disguise her as a Firbolg for the time being. The party rests in preparation for a long day ahead of
            them the next day.

        <p>
            Sea hags are one of the most repulsive and wretched of hags and are prideful in their gruesome
            appearance. The wicked fey live near or within large bodies of water and the unfortunate souls that
            set eyes on them are often feasted on shortly after.
